CocoaUPnP is a logical progression of [upnpx](https://github.com/fkuehne/upnpx) - designed to be easy, modern and block-based. It is written in Objective-C and is currently available iOS. Mac OS X compatibility is currently unknown, but we don't see a major reason why this wouldn't work.

## Why not Swift?

There are a few reasons why we didn't opt for Swift for the first version of this library. Firstly, the app we are using this in is entirely Objective-C. We need it written fast, so Objective-C was the way to go. Additionally, the app targets iOS 7, so we are unable to use dynamic libraries generated by [CocoaPods](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-0.36/). Additionally, there was some initial friction with early Swift versions that required a lot of maintenance.

It is highly likely that the library will be ported to Swift at some point, but I am unable to give a specific timeline.  If you want a UPnP library for your Swift project, I can recommend [UPnAtom](https://github.com/master-nevi/UPnAtom/).

## Project timeline

Initially, this project will focus on the Audio/Video [Device Control Protocols](http://upnp.org/sdcps-and-certification/standards/sdcps/). Once these protocols have been properly implemented and tested, then the rest of the protocols may be added at a later stage.

## Dependencies

We have tried to limit the number of dependencies within the library to only use well tested, used-and-approved libraries. As a result there are only 5 dependencies within CocoaUPnP itself:

- [CocoaAsyncSocket](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket) - for connecting to the SSDP protocol.
- [CocoaSSDP](https://github.com/sboisson/CocoaSSDP) - this library has been heavily modified and rigorously tested for use in CocoaUPnP.
- [Ono](https://github.com/mattt/Ono) - for faster and easier XML parsing.
- [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) - to leverage use of response and request serialising.
- [GCDWebServer](https://github.com/swisspol/GCDWebServer) - provides most of the socket based functionality of the UPnP event server.

Additionally, the test target uses 4 testing libraries:

- [Specta](https://github.com/specta/specta)
- [Expecta](https://github.com/specta/expecta)
- [OCMock](http://ocmock.org/)
- [OHHTTPStubs](https://github.com/AliSoftware/OHHTTPStubs)


## Testing

CocoaUPnP is as test-driven as much as possible to ensure confidence that the library works as intended. When submitting a Pull Request, you should run the suite of unit tests to ensure your patch does not break existing functionality. Please ensure you add a test for the new feature you have added. You can look at the existing tests to get an idea of how to do this.

### Writing tests

When creating a new class, create a test class at the same time. Tests are written with [Specta](https://github.com/specta/specta), with accompanying [Expecta](https://github.com/specta/expecta) matchers.

Both the [Specta](https://github.com/specta/specta) and [Expecta](https://github.com/specta/expecta) imports are declared in the [ExampleTests-Prefix.pch](https://github.com/arcam/CocoaUPnP/blob/master/Example/ExampleTests-Prefix.pch) file, so no need to import them in each spec.

## Contributing

Pull requests are always welcome. If you feel like getting stuck into the project, there are several ways you can help out.

- Update documentation (spelling & grammar, etc)
- Design a neat icon for the library
- Tackle one of the project's [issues](https://github.com/arcam/CocoaUPnP/issues)
- Submit a new [issue or feature request](https://github.com/arcam/CocoaUPnP/issues/new)

### Submitting a Pull Request

New features should always be added in a seperate topic branch on your fork. Tests are run through [xcpretty](https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty), so be sure to install that first.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/CocoaUPnP.git

Change your directory to your `CocoaUPnP` folder:

    cd CocoaUPnP

Install Pods:

    pod install

Run the tests to make sure nothing is broken, and your test environment is setup:

    make tests

Create and checkout a feature branch:

    git checkout -b awesomeNewFeature

Make your changes, then re-run the tests:

    make tests

Commit and push to your fork then [submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/arcam/CocoaUPnP/compare/).
